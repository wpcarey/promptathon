## Best Practices for Using GenAI
### Assume Everything is Public

- **NEVER** put PHI into public generative AI tools
  - If you aren't sure if something is PHI, **err on the side of caution** and don't submit it
- **NEVER** put sensitive info into public generative AI tools
- Companies can store your prompts to train their models (many have opt-out clauses)
- **Assume everything you put into the system could be publicly available in perpetuity to other system users**
- **ALWAYS** check your institution’s generative AI policies

- Make sure if you use GenAI to write articles to check the journal’s policies

### Know Your Model
You don't have to be a machine learning expert to be an educated consumer of GenAI tools. 

Some good questions to ask yourself when using a model include:
- What is the name of the model I'm using?
- What kind of data was the model trained on? 
- When was the training data last updated? 
- Are your prompts/inputs being used to train the model?
- Who has access to your results?
