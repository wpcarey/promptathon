# Getting Started

## Helpful Terms
- **Prompt:** This is text that you input into the GenAI to tell it what task to perform
- **Prompt Box:** Where you type in your prompt
- **Context Window:** The amount of content (measured in tokens) that the system can "remember" at a given time
- **Token:** A unit of information used in the GenAI that could be a word, punctuation, or part of a word
- **Large Language Model (LLM):** A flexible AI model that can interpret and mimic human language (natural language processing) to perform various tasks

## Tools We Will Be Using
For this workshop, you should have access to the internet and a functioning web browser.

We will be using the free versions of the following LLMs. You can create an account for free if you'd like to save your work for future reference.

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
- [OpenEvidence](https://www.openevidence.com)

## Notes
For many models, the free versions will have a limit on the number of tokens you can use in a certain time or the types of analyses you can perform. Each tool will have its own constraints. Try to find out what limits you have so you know what you can expect from your interaction with the GenAI. In ChatGPT for example, when you hit your free limit, the model will switch from the most updated version (GPT 4o or 4o-mini) to an older model (ChatGPT 3.5).
