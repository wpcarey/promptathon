# Activity: Summarizing an Article

## Objectives
- Use ChatGPT (or OpenEvidence) to create a summary and journal club outline for an article
- Learn how to refine a prompt to get more useful results
- Understand the importance of critiquing and verifying outputs

ChatGPT and OpenEvidence can be very helpful in generating article summaries

As  an  example, I’m using a [paper we’ve seen before](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8218233/) as part of our Journal Clubs and will ask ChatGPT to generate an outline:

>Wong A, Otles E, Donnelly JP, et al. External Validation of a Widely Implemented Proprietary Sepsis Prediction Model in Hospitalized Patients [published correction appears in JAMA Intern Med. 2021 Aug 1;181(8):1144. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.3907]. JAMA Intern Med. 2021;181(8):1065-1070. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.2626

Depending on the model you’re using, you may have to copy and paste the article directly into your prompt box or attach a file with the content you want summarized. A free text version of the article is available here: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8218233/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8218233/)

## Let's Prompt

First round, zero shot:
> Summarize the following article: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8218233/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8218233/)

Can we do a better job? Try coming up with a prompt that might be more useful for you.
