# Activity: Generating a Topic-Specific Overview

## Objectives
- Use ChatGPT or OpenEvidence to create an overview of a topic
- Use the model to help verify its own outputs through iterative prompting and feedback
- Use context windows to create study tools based on your summary
- Recognize the importance of training data by comparing outputs between ChatGPT and OpenEvidence

## Let's Prompt
We already saw how effective GenAI can be at generating summaries.

For this activity, pick a topic that you are very familiar with and ask the model to create an overview for you.

As a starting point, a good generic type of prompt might be:

>I am a [TYPE OF LEARNER]. Please provide an overview of [TOPIC] in bullet-point format to be used for [PURPOSE]. Cite all sources in [FORMAT]. Do not use sources that do not exist.

Here's an [example](https://chatgpt.com/share/678ff45b-fe50-800f-8ddc-fee05b4e8355):

>I am a first-year internal medicine resident. Please give me a 5-minute summary of the current recommendations for starting statins in patients over 21. Use tables and bullet points whenever possible. Please cite all references with links.

Can we do a better job? Try coming up with a prompt that might be more useful for you.
